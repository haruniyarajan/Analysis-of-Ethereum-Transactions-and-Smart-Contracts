# Analysis-of-Ethereum-Transactions-and-Smart-Contracts

Ethereum is a blockchain based distributed computing platform where users may exchange
currency (Ether), provide or purchase services (smart contracts), mint their own coinage
(tokens), as well as other applications. The Ethereum network is fully decentralized, managed
by public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work to process/verify
transactions. A subset of the Ethereum data is provided on the data repository bucket
/data-repository-bkt/ECS765/ethereum-parvulus. We are provided with three datasets:
ethereum transactions, ethereum block data used to acquire mining details, and ethereum
contracts used to design smart contracts.

PART A. TIME ANALYSIS
i) Bar plot showing the number of transactions occurring every month
between the start and end of the dataset.
ii) Bar plot showing the average value of transaction in each month
between the start and end of the dataset.

PART B. TOP TEN MOST POPULAR SERVICES
Top ten smart contracts by total ether received.

PART C. TOP TEN MOST ACTIVE MINERS
Top ten miners by the size of the blocks mined.

PART D. DATA EXPLORATION
i) Scam Analysis : Popular Scams
Identifying the most lucrative scams and analyzing the ether change over
time.
ii) Miscellaneous Analysis : Gas guzzler
Analysis of gas price and gas used for contract transactions over time.
